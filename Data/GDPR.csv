The video surveillance subject of the proceedings is therefore not limited to areas which are under the exclusive power of control of the controller. Video surveillance is therefore not proportionate to the purpose and not limited to what is necessary.

Update: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach. Finally, the court considers that the negligent nature of the breach should be taken into account."

The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient.

Addendum: In the meantime, the court has cancelled the fine due to procedural errors. The amount of the fine has to be determined by the concrete number of data records concerned. However, the Office had not submitted any verifiable evidence in this regard, but had simply assumed that 6 million data sets were involved, which the data controller had denied. Therefore, important statements were missing. In particular, it was incorrect to justify the amount of the fine on the basis of general preventive considerations. Art. 58 GDPR expressly states that a fine imposed must be related to the specific facts of the case.

When determining the amount of the fine (PLN 55,750.50), the President of UODO also took into account, among others, the duration of the infringement and the fact that it concerned a large group of persons (585 judges). It concluded that although the infringement was finally removed, it was of a serious nature.However, when imposing a penalty, the President of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection also took into account mitigating circumstances, such as good cooperation between the controller and the supervisory authority or lack of evidence that damage had been caused to the persons whose data had been disclosed."

The fine was imposed against the school which had used facial recognition technology to monitor the attendance of students. Even though, in general, data processing for the purpose of monitoring attendance is possible doing so with facial recognition is disproportioned to the goal to monitor attendance.  The supervisory authority is of the opinion that biometric data of students was processed which is why Art. 9 GDPR is applicable. Additionally, the authority argued that consent can not be applied since students and their guardians cannot freely decide if they/their children want to be monitored for attendance purposes. When examining if the school board can rely on any of the exemptions listed in Art. 9 (2), the supervisory authority found that this was not the case. The supervisory authority also found that there was a case of a processing activity with high risks since new technology was used to process sensitive personal data concerning children who are in a dependency position to the high school board and due to camera surveillance being used in the students everyday environment. In the view of the authority, the school board was not able to demonstrate compliance with Art. 35 GDPR and that the school board was required to consult the authority in accordance with Art. 36 (1) GDPR."

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low.

At notebooksbilliger.de, however, the video surveillance was neither limited to a specific period nor to specific employees. In addition, the recordings were stored for 60 days in many cases, which was significantly longer than required. Customers of notebooksbilliger.de were also affected by the unlawful video surveillance, as some cameras were pointed at seating areas in the sales area. So far, the fine against notebooksbilliger.de is the highest fine that the LfD Niedersachen has issued under the GDPR."

Customers of the bank were supposed to accept new privacy policies allowing the controller to transfer the customers' personal data to all companies within the CaixaBank Group. At the same time, the data subjects were not given the option of specifically not consenting to this transfer. Instead, if they wished to disagree with the transfer of their data, they were required to send a letter of disagreement to each individual company in the group.

The DPA concluded that the bank had violated its information obligations as set out in Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR, as the information provided to customers under the privacy policy was not consistent, contained imprecise terminology, and did not provide sufficient information on the type of personal data processed and the nature of the processing.  Also, the information on the rights of the data subjects as well as the contact information of the controller were not provided in a consistent manner. 

Furthermore, the DPA notes that the controller had processed its customers' data beyond its legitimate interests, partly without a legal basis, and that the consent it obtained from customers did not meet the requirements of an effective consent. In addition, deficiencies in the company's procedures allowed it to obtain the consent of customers to process their personal data.

These recordings could be viewed via a live video stream on Youtube and on the controller's homepage. In addition, the recordings could be rewound for up to twelve hours. 

The area covered by the camera surveillance included a public street, the parking lot and entrance of two grocery stores, a pharmacy, a liquor store, the local bank, city hall, and a number of other buildings.

It was not possible to make out facial details or read license plates on cars due to the image quality and distance from the camera. Nevertheless, the image quality was good enough to be able to identify what type of car the data subjects were driving, what type of clothing they were wearing, what hair color they had, and other personal characteristics. This was sufficient for those watching the live broadcast to identify and track co-workers, colleagues, friends, family, or other acquaintances.

The Norwegian DPA concluded that the live broadcast constitutes a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) a) GPDR.

The decision highlights that the illegal camera surveillance involved a significant number of employees and that many were monitored repeatedly, some on a daily basis. Those who were monitored were on their way to and from work, who needed to buy groceries, medications, or alcohol, or who were in the public area for other reasons. These are activities where the data subjects do not expect to be monitored, and even less they expect the monitoring to be broadcast live on the Internet."

The controller had equipped ticket inspectors with body-worn cameras, which were designed to prevent threatening situations, document incidents, and ensure that the right person was fined for traveling on Stockholm's public transportation without a valid ticket.
Ticket inspectors were required to keep the camera on for their entire shift and were therefore able to film all passengers who passed the inspector. Since several hundred thousand people use public transportation in Stockholm every day, a large number of people were thus at risk of being monitored by video and audio recordings.

The DPA believes that body-worn camera technology could be used to prevent and document threatening situations, but that the pre-recording time should be reduced to a maximum of 15 seconds, as a longer pre-recording time is not necessary to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. Furthermore the DPA found that audio recordings did not contribute to the identification of persons without a valid ticket. The DPA therefore considered the audio recordings to be a violation of the principles of legality and transparency as well as data minimization.

EUR 2,500,000 for unlawfully processing the personal data of approximately 8000 drivers. Garante's investigation revealed numerous and serious data protection violations.
The violations included a lack of transparency in the algorithms used to manage drivers, both when assigning jobs and when booking work shifts.
Deliveroo had used a centralized system for driver management through which it then processed and managed the assignment of orders as well as the booking of work shifts.
However, Garante notes that the controller did not adequately inform the drivers about the functioning of the system they had installed on their smartphones, and did not ensure the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used to evaluate the drivers. 
In addition, Garante found that Deliveroo carried out a meticulous control of the drivers' work performance - through the continuous geolocation of their device, which went far beyond what was necessary to assign the order (e.g., recording the position every 12 seconds) - and through the storage of a large amount of personal data collected during the execution of the orders, including communication with customer service. In this context, the storage period of the various data had not been defined in a manner appropriate to the purpose. Instead, the controller had defined a flat storage period of six years. Furthermore, the Garante found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate security of the processing. Deliveroo Italy had also not conducted a data protection impact assessment, although this would have been necessary due to the risk posed to the drivers."

ETid-820,IRELAND,02/09/2021,225000000,WhatsApp Ireland Ltd.,"['Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR', ' Art. 12 GDPR', ' Art. 13 GDPR', ' Art. 14 GDPR']",Insufficient fulfilment of information obligations,<a class='blau' href='https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/dpc_final_decision_redacted_for_issue_to_edpb_01-09-21_en.pdf' target='_blank'>link</a> <a class='blau' href='https://dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-whatsapp-inquiry' target='_blank'>link</a>,Data Protection Authority of Ireland,"Media, Telecoms and Broadcasting","The Irish DPA (DPC) has imposed a fine of EUR 225,000,000 on WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. 

In the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. 

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. 

Based on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. 

The fine is composed as follows:

EUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and
EUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.


With respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.

With regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. 

Given the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR."

No information was provided regarding the legal basis, the retention period of the personal data and the data subjects' right to object. Also, the privacy notice was confusing and the wording contained grammatical errors and used terms that are not part of common usage.

In addition, the privacy notice required a tax identification number in order to issue a simplified invoice, i.e., an invoice not exceeding the amount of EUR 3,000. The AEPD found this to be a violation of the principle of legality. 

The fine is composed as follows:

On June 12, 2020, the DPA received a notification from the region regarding a personal data security breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. According to the notification, all patients and staff at a lifestyle center were able to access a building where up to 100,000 physical patient records were stored, including health information and personal identity number details. The reason for this was that both staff and patients had been given key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, regardless of whether the user was required to access them. 
In addition, passersby were able to take a look at the covers of some of the records -which showed personal data such as identity numbers and names - through a window in the building.
In this context, the DPA found that the Midtjylland Region had not taken adequate security measures for the storage of personal data.

In addition, the region had not established sufficient guidelines for access restrictions when creating key cards, and had not conducted adequate periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures taken. 

In evaluating the question of whether a fine should be imposed, the Danish DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, that the region processed large amounts of sensitive data, such as health data."

Part of the equipment was supplied by another company, Flowbird Italia s.r.l. All parking information was then managed through a centralized system, which could also be accessed through an app by the employees responsible for controlling parking fees.

Irregularities were then identified during the investigation. Namely, the city of Rome, as data controller, had not provided information on the processing of the drivers' data, had not designated the company Atac as data processor, and had not provided it with the necessary instructions to process the data collected. Also, the subcontractor was not formally instructed nor instructed on how to proceed with the data processing.

It was also found that the companies had not established a data processing register. Also, the retention periods for the collected data were not specified, and appropriate security measures were not taken. For example, it was found that at the time of the audit, some data flows to and from the system implemented by Atac were going through insecure channels. In addition, officials could have checked any license plate en masse and repeatedly over time, for example, to find out a person's habits and parking location. 


In calculating the fine for the unlawful data processing, the DPA aggravatingly took into account the large amount of personal data processed (from June 2018 to November 2019, the system established by Atac had already collected the data of 8,600,000 stops and potentially affects all users of the paid parking service in the city area) and the sanctions already received for data protection violations, but also the positive cooperation offered by the city and the companies to remedy some violations detected during the inspection."

Through a report on the state-owned broadcasting company NRK, the Norwegian DPA became aware that Ferde AS was transferring information on passages in toll rings to a data processor in China. On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.

As part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.

These images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. 

After its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. 

For one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. 

In addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect."

The controller had obtained the information regarding the data subject's ownership of the property from an openly accessible public register. At no time had the data subject consented to such a contact request. The controller had argued during the DPA's investigation that consent for others to contact her could be inferred from the fact that she had a public profile. However, the DPA noted that the exchange of information via a social network should only allow for what is specified in the relevant terms of use. The DPA clarified that the platform is intended to enable the exchange of contact information in order to make job offers. In contrast, it is not intended that users use the platform to send messages to other users in order to sell services. Moreover, it is irrelevant whether a user profile is public or not.

A visitor to the residence filed a complaint with the DPA. He based this on an installed video surveillance system in the accommodation. The video surveillance system recorded, among other things, the corridor connecting the accommodation with the communal showers. Moreover, the footage was not only recorded but also displayed in real time on the monitors of the concierge staff, creating the risk that the images could also be inadvertently seen by visitors or suppliers. During the course of the investigation, the institution's administration justified the installation of the video surveillance system by citing the need to prevent theft and ensure the health of residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic period. 

The DPA found that the institute thereby violated the principles of lawfulness, transparency and data minimization. The fact that, as claimed by the institute, the passage of the guests to the shower rooms was filmed only occasionally and for a short duration, and that the quality of the recordings was not 'perfectly clear,' does not resolve the unlawfulness of the recordings. Also, the DPA noted that some procedural precautions - such as scheduling time windows to turn off the cameras to allow guests to visit the shower rooms without being filmed, or temporarily ensuring the security of the locations through alternative measures, such as the use of security personnel - may allow the institute to pursue the purpose of the video surveillance in an equally effective manner and avoid unjustifiably restricting the freedoms of the data subjects.

Furthermore, the DPA found that the institute had not properly fulfilled its duty to inform. The institute had only provided the data subjects with detailed information about the video surveillance system on the bulletin board after the investigation had begun. However, this type of information is not suitable for visually impaired people. The institute should have provided the residents with a pre-recorded audio message that could be played back if necessary."

A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. 
Eventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR."

EUR 3,296,326 for illegal telemarketing. 
The DPA's decision followed a complex investigation launched after dozens of reports and complaints from people who claimed that they received unsolicited promotional calls and promotional SMS both from Sky Italia directly and through call centers of other companies. 
In this regard, the DPA found that the promotional calls were made without adequately informing the users (such as about the origin of the personal data transmitted to Sky Italia). Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.  Only after obtaining consent, Sky would then have been allowed to proceed with the commercial offers. 
Sky used lists of data it had acquired from other companies for these promotional purposes. Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.
In addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market."

The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions. Further, CNIL found that RATP did not adequately differentiate between staff authorization levels, allowing more staff than necessary to access certain data.

According to the company, they learned about the security breach from another cybersecurity service provider who informed them that the customer data of 110,302 CityBee users had been published on the website of the hacking forum RaidForums.com. This included data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, personal identification numbers, driver's license numbers, type of payment card and the last four digits of the card number of the data subjects. 

The DPA's investigation revealed that the published data originated from an unsecured backup copy of a database. 

The DPA found that the data breach occurred due to the company's failure to comply with its obligation to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects. 

The company had, for example, failed to appoint a person with appropriate competence to be responsible for security and risk management.  It had also failed to ensure that accesses to database files were logged and evaluated. 
In addition, the company had stored the database unencrypted, so that a person with technical knowledge could have had full access to the data in the file after downloading it. The personal codes in the database were furthermore stored unprotected and the passwords in the database were only encrypted with an encryption algorithm that was considered insecure."

The said data had also been processed for the purpose of combating organized fraud and for automatic classification in the authority's risk system. However, even for these purposes, the processing would not have been necessary.

Under GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. 

Users had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. 


The DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. Grindr users would sometimes want to use the app anonymously without, for example, giving their full name or uploading a photo of themselves. With the sexual orientation of the users, a special category of personal data, which is subject to a particularly high level of protection, was therefore also affected. 

The DPA therefore considers the infringement to be a particularly serious case that justifies a deterrent high fine. Business models based on behavior-based marketing are widespread in the digital economy, making it important that the fines for GDPR violations are deterrent."

In September 2020, the psychotherapy center reported an attack on its patient database to the DPA. An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.

The most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected. The patient database server was open to the Internet without firewall protection during the period between November 26, 2017, and March 13, 2019.

For this reason, the DPA determined that the personal data were not adequately protected against unauthorized and unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage, and that the controller had not implemented basic measures for the secure processing of personal data.

As part of its investigation, the DPA also determined that the controller must have known as early as March 2019 that data in the patient information system had been lost and could have been compromised by an external attacker. Vastaamo should have immediately reported the security breach to both the DPA and its patients. However, Vastaamo was significantly late in meeting this obligation.

The DPA had received several complaints against IAB Europe since 2019. In the context of this complaint, the compliance of the 'Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF)' with the GDPR was mainly questioned. The TCF was developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR by organizations using the OpenRTB protocol. 

The OpenRTB protocol is a protocol for 'real-time bidding,' which is the automated online auction of user profiles for the sale and purchase of advertising space on the Internet. When users visit a website that contains an ad space, technology companies, through an automated auction system, can bid in real time for that ad space to display personalized advertising. 

When users visit a website for the first time, an interface appears through which they can consent to the collection and sharing of their personal information or object to various types of processing. 

As part of the TCF, a consent management tool appears during this process. The tool allows the user to object to certain types of data processing. The TCF registers the user's preferences through the tool by generating a TC string and sends it to all partners participating in the OpenRTB system. Based on this TC string, user profiles are compiled, which are then passed on to advertisers. This makes it visible to them what kind of data processing the users have agreed to. 

Within the scope of its investigation against IAB, the DPA identified a number of violations of the GDPR.

It found that the TC strings already constituted personal data and therefore IAB was required to have a legal basis for processing these data. However, IAB was unable to demonstrate any such legal basis.

In addition, IAB did not properly inform users about the functioning of the TCF. For example, the information provided to users was too generic and vague to understand the scope of the data processing. 

Furthermore, IAB had not maintained a register of its processing activities, had not appointed a data protection officer, as well as had not conducted a data protection impact assessment."

The decision is based on twelve notifications of data breaches that occurred between June 7, 2018 and December 4, 2018. 

The outcome of the DPC's investigation revealed that Meta had violated Article 5 (2) GDPR and Article 24 (1) GDPR. In the course of its investigation, the DPC found that Meta failed to demonstrate that it had taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data of EU users. 

The fine proceedings involved cross-border data processing, which is why the decision was subject to the co-decision procedure under Art. 60 GDPR involving all other European supervisory authorities as co-decision-makers.  Although two European DPAs objected to the DPC's draft decision, a consensus was ultimately reached. Accordingly, the DPC's decision reflects the collective views of the DPC and the other European DPAs."

This is particularly serious as the Foreign Ministry has processed an average of 530,000 visa applications per year over the last three years and the personal data processed in the course of the applications was therefore inadequately secured.

The data included sensitive information such as fingerprints, name, address, place of residence, country of birth, purpose of travel and nationality. 

Due to the inadequate security measures, it would have been possible for unauthorized persons to access the data. 

According to DPA, the Foreign Ministry had been aware of the security flaws in the visa system for some time. Despite this knowledge, the Ministry did not adjust the security measures in time. For this reason, the DPA finds that the Ministry acted with gross negligence. 

The DPA also found that the Foreign Ministry did not adequately inform individuals who applied for visas that their personal information would be shared with other parties."

For this reason, the former managing director requested to exercise their right to delete, restrict the processing of their personal data and object.

This is the highest fine ever imposed by the Dutch DPA

As part of its investigation, the DPA found a number of violations of the GDPR. 

The Tax and Customs Administration had kept a list for several years on which it recorded indications of fraud. The list contained information on over 270,000 individuals, including minors. The administration had processed personal data such as health, citizenship, and criminal personal data as part of the list maintenance.

The DPA initially found that the administration did not have a valid legal basis for processing the data contained in the list. For this reason, the data were processed unlawfully. 

Further, the DPA found that the information in the list was often incorrect, so that a large number of individuals were falsely registered as possible fraudsters. 

In addition, the investigation revealed that the maintenance of the list led to discrimination against some individuals, as the risk of fraud was determined on the basis of the nationality and appearance of the data subjects, among other factors. For example, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud. 

Furthermore, the DPA found that the administration violated its obligation under the GDPR to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure adequate protection of the personal data it collects. Indeed, the administration had inadequately secured the personal data. 

The DPA also found that the administration had violated the principle of storage limitation by storing the data for a longer time contrary to the retention period established for the personal data in the list.

Furthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data in the list had not been necessary for the administration to properly perform its tasks. The processing was therefore disproportionate. Also, the administration had not sufficiently defined the purposes underlying the processing and thus violated the principle of purpose limitation. 

The fine is composed as follows: 

EUR 1 million for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR;
EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR;
EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR;

For example, no specific procedure for data migration operations had been implemented. Also, the leaked data had not been stored in encrypted form on the server. In addition, the DPA found that DEDALUS lacked authentication for access to the public area of the server.
